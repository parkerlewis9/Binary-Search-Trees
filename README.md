# Binary Search Trees

This repo will provide information about the binary search tree data structure as well as exercises to apply algorithms to retrieve meaningful information from the trees.


A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer to utilize resources efficiently. 

We create and use "data structres" to organize data in our computer in a way that will allow us to utilize that data efficiently.

One such very common data structure is known as a "tree". Broadly, a tree is just an organized collection of "nodes". A "node" is a container for the data we are organizing. There is an implicit implication that the data contained in these nodes are related in some meaningful way. The restrictions we put on relating these nodes are how we create different types of trees with different properties. Due to these restricitions, different properties emerge from these trees. Properties of general trees are these:
